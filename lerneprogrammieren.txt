born a lady fall to committee then in general it's recommended meet regularly to commit often not too often if it doesn't make sense of course but as soon as you think you have added something useful to your cold why not add another code for me exclamation point if you're unsure about Sir change well maybe first to commit at new change do another for me if you then realize that the last change was nonsense just throw it away when we do something in my project like there's some change then I said nothing really the project I changed something and otherwise it doesn't help me? you want to document what does this connection between the previous section and the calculator yeah and now you decide okay I want I want that enhance my calculator I know I also wanted to be able to do multiplication so you could already have it permit where you know the telephone is the works you do it as a snapshot as a safety point and then you add new logic to add multiplication that would make sense yeah keep this very clever it does not always store everything and then it saves differences for everything and it's a chain reaction it's so huge but but it saves so much memory because imagine every commit saves everything that would be horrible??
